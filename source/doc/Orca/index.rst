BigDL-Orca
=========================

Most AI projects start with a Python notebook running on a single laptop; however, one usually needs to go through a mountain of pains to scale it to handle larger data set in a distributed fashion. The  **BigDL-Orca** (or **Orca** for short) library seamlessly scales out your single node Python notebook across large clusters (so as to process distributed Big Data).
