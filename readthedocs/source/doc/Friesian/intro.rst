Friesian Introduction
==========================

BigDL Friesian is an application framework for building optimized large-scale recommender solutions. The recommending workflows built on top of Friesian can seamlessly scale out to distributed big data clusters in the production environment.

Friesian provides end-to-end support for three typical stages in a modern recommendation system:

- Offline stage: distributed feature engineering and model training.
- Nearline stage: Feature and model updates.
- Online stage: Recall and ranking.

The overall architecture of Friesian is shown in the following diagram:
