# Deploy the Intel SGX Device Plugin for Kubernetes

The instructions in this section are modified from the [Intel SGX Device Plugin homepage][intelSGX], to which please refer should questions arise.

## Prerequisites
Prerequisites for building and running these device plugins include:
- Appropriate hardware. ([3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable Processors][GIXSP])
- A fully configured Kubernetes cluster
- A working Go environment, of at least version v1.16

Here we would want to deploy the plugin as a DaemonSet, so pull the [source code][pluginCode]. In the working directory, compile with 
``` bash
make intel-sgx-plugin
make intel-sgx-initcontainer
```
Deploy the DaemonSet with
```bash
kubectl apply -k deployments/sgx_plugin/overlays/epc-register/
```
Verify with (replace the `<node name>` with your own node name)
```
kubectl describe node <node name> | grep sgx.intel.com
```
